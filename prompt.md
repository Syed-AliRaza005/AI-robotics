<!-- # 🤖 Project: Physical AI Textbook (Fully Autonomous Spec-Kit Workflow)

## Primary Goal
You are an expert AI development agent. Your task is to autonomously design, plan, and structure a Docusaurus 3.x textbook for the **"Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"** course. All required course details are contained within the existing file: **`hackathon.md`**.

**Deployment Context:** The final Docusaurus site must be built using the **latest documentation (Docusaurus 3.x)** and must be configured for seamless, robust deployment on modern, high-performance environments like **Context7 (MCPS)**.

---

## Phase 0: Specification Generation (The Input)

**ACTION REQUIRED:**
1.  **Read and Analyze:** Thoroughly read and analyze the **`hackathon.md`** file. This file contains the complete course details (Modules, Weekly Breakdown, Hardware, Assessments).
2.  **Internalize:** Understand the key architectural and content requirements (ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA, 13-week structure).

---

## Phase 1: Spec-Kit File Creation (Autonomous /constitution & /specify)

**OBJECTIVE:** Create the two required Spec-Kit foundational files using the information from `hackathon.md`.

### 1A. 📜 Generate `constitution.md` (The Rules)
**ACTION:** Create the content for **`constitution.md`**.
* **Rules Focus:** Define the non-negotiable standards: Docusaurus 3.x, use of latest dependencies for **Context7 compatibility**, high code quality, use of Python for code examples, and GitHub Pages deployment configuration.

### 1B. 📝 Generate `spec.md` (The Blueprint)
**ACTION:** Create the content for **`spec.md`**.
* **Blueprint Focus:** Define the "WHAT" of the project: The exact Docusaurus sidebar structure (mapping the 13 weeks), all required content pages (Hardware, Outcomes, Assessments), and the high-level acceptance criteria.

---

## Phase 2: Planning and Task Breakdown

### 2A. 🗺️ Planning Phase (`/sp.plan`)
**OBJECTIVE:** Generate the detailed technical implementation plan.

**COMMAND:** `/sp.plan based on constitution.md and spec.md`

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:** The output must be the complete content of the **`plan.md`** file, detailing Docusaurus setup, configuration of `docusaurus.config.js` (including base URL for deployment), and the full file structure.

### 2B. 📋 Tasks Phase (`/sp.tasks`)
**OBJECTIVE:** Convert the plan into a sequential, actionable task list.

**COMMAND:** `/sp.tasks from plan.md`

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:** The output must be the complete content of the **`tasks.md`** file, with granular steps suitable for direct execution.

---

## Phase 3: Implementation and Execution

### 3. 🛠️ Implementation Phase (`/implement`)
**OBJECTIVE:** Begin executing the tasks to build the project.

**COMMAND:** `/sp.implement <Start with Task 1 from tasks.md>`

**WORKFLOW:** After generating all three files (`constitution.md`, `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`), you must immediately begin executing the first task from `tasks.md` using the `/sp.implement` command.

---

## Initial Output Request
Start by performing Phase 1. Your first response must contain the content of the fully generated **`constitution.md`** file, followed immediately by the content of the fully generated **`spec.md`** file. Do not proceed to `/plan` yet.

 # 🌟 Physical AI Textbook Project: Full 5-Step Autonomous Spec-Kit Workflow

## 🎯 Primary Goal
You are an expert AI software development agent. Your mission is to autonomously develop a Docusaurus 3.x textbook for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" course. You must use the full 5-step Spec-Kit Plus process.

**Input Source:** All comprehensive course details (structure, content, hardware, and learning outcomes) are contained within the existing file: **`hackathon.md`**.

**Technical Context (Context7/MCPS):** The final project must utilize **latest Docusaurus documentation (3.x)** and be configured for robust, modern deployment on systems like **Context7 (MCPS/CI/CD)**.

---

## Phase 1: Specification Generation (Autonomous File Creation)

**OBJECTIVE:** Create the two foundational Spec-Kit files based *only* on the content of **`hackathon.md`**.

### 1. 📜 Constitution (`/sp.constitution`)
**ACTION:** Generate the complete content for the **`constitution.md`** file.
* **Focus:** Define all project standards, including Docusaurus 3.x, **Context7 deployment compliance**, code quality, and the use of Markdown/Python.

### 2. 📝 Specification (`/sp.spec`)
**ACTION:** Generate the complete content for the **`spec.md`** file.
* **Focus:** Define the book's entire structure: the 13-week sidebar mapping, required pages (Hardware, Assessments), and high-level acceptance criteria.

---

## Phase 2: Planning and Task Breakdown (Using Generated Specs)

### 3. 🗺️ Plan (`/sp.plan`)
**OBJECTIVE:** Generate the detailed technical implementation plan (`plan.md`).

**COMMAND:** `/plan based on constitution.md and spec.md`

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:** The full content of the **`plan.md`** file, detailing Docusaurus setup, configuration updates for deployment, and the complete file structure.

### 4. 📋 Tasks (`/sp.tasks`)
**OBJECTIVE:** Convert the plan into a sequential, granular task list.

**COMMAND:** `/tasks from plan.md`

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:** The full content of the **`tasks.md`** file, ready for step-by-step execution.

---

## Phase 3: Implementation

### 5. 🛠️ Implement (`/sp.implement`)
**OBJECTIVE:** Begin executing the structural tasks to build the Docusaurus project.

**COMMAND:** `/implement <Start with Task 1 from tasks.md>`

**WORKFLOW:** After generating all four required files (`constitution.md`, `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`), you must immediately proceed to execute the first task from `tasks.md` using the `/implement` command.
